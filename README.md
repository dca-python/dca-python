Hey everyone, David here 👋🏻

I'm an economist by training, with a solid background in mathematical modeling and applied statistics using R. Recently, I've become fascinated with machine learning, which led me to complete Le Wagon's intensive *Data Science & AI* bootcamp, where I spent 660 hours immersed in data science using Python, SQL, and a variety of MLOps tools.

As a final project, we collaborated in a team of four to develop a cloud-hosted deforestation tracker web application, addressing the compliance needs set forth by the EU Deforestation Regulation (2023/1115). We use latest-available satellite imagery and a self-made convolutional neural networks to analyze changes in rainforest coverage. Check it out!
